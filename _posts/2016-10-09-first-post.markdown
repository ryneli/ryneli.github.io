This blog is trying to backup the steps to build my homepage.

1. Create repo with name ryneli.github.io
2. Install jekyll with `sudo apt install jekyll`
3. Run `jekyll new` to initialize the website
4. Run `jekyll build` to convert posts in `_post` to html format
5. Run `jekyll serve` to preview the result
6. Push the update to github
